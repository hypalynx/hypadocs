# Hypadocs

Simple documentation theme for hugo, with Manrope font & Mermaid.js included
ready to go and start writing stuff down!

I hope you like using this theme, we created this project to make it easy to
create a place for writing down information for our projects.

## Getting Started

Create your new hugo project with `hugo new site .` or `hugo new site
new-project` if you haven't already created a folder.

Then include the theme as a submodule: `git submodule add git@github.com:hypalynx/hypadocs.git ./themes/hypadocs`.

Then update your site `config.toml` to include `theme = "hypadocs"`.

You should be ready to start documenting at this point, updating the theme is
easy: `git submodule update --recursive`.
